FunnyIdeas__DMV-Driving-Test-Position-Checker-by-Yukun
======================================================

A self-written code to automatically check whether there is available position for driving test, 
which saves much effort to check manually.

When I learned driving, I found it pretty annoying to manually imput my info, in order to search 
for avaiable testing postions. And what makes more trouble is that I have to check many times to find
the suitable positions.

So I wrote this code. When you start to run it, it will automatically check the DMV website for driving
every certain time(you can set the time period as you want), you don't even need to log into your 
account yourself. All you need to do is go and get a cup of coffee and start dealing other stuffs, when
it finds suitable positions that meets your requirement, it will send an email to you.

PS: I took the driving test twice, the good thing was my code saved me much time, and the unfortunate thing
is I failed both of them XD...
